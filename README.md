### A User-friendly Implementation of Kohonen's Self-Organizing Maps

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lutzhamel/popsom7/master/map.png)

An implementation of Kohonen's self-organizing maps with a number of distinguishing features:

1. An easy to use interface for building and evaluating self-organizing maps.

2. Automatic centroid detection and [visualization using starbursts](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/citations;jsessionid=ADD8A6B07C6E90AC162CC1BCA57E996E?doi=10.1.1.217.6666).

3. Two models of the data: (a) a self organizing map model, (b) a centroid based clustering model.

4. A number of easily accessible [quality metrics for the self organizing map](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-28518-4_4) and the centroid based cluster model.
