Description: Self-organizing maps with a number of distinguishing features:
    (1) Automatic centroid detection and cluster visualization using starbursts, for more details see the paper "Improved Interpretability of the Unified Distance Matrix with
Connected Components" by Hamel and Brown (2011) in <ISBN:1-60132-168-6>.
    (2) Two models of the data: (a) a self organizing map model, (b) a centroid based clustering model.
    (3) A number of easily accessible quality metrics, Hamel (2016) <doi:10.1007/978-3-319-28518-4_4>.
