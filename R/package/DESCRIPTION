Description: Self-organizing maps with a number of distinguishing features:
    (1) Automatic centroid detection and cluster visualization using starbursts.
    (2) Two models of the data: (a) a self organizing map model, (b) a centroid based clustering model.
    (3) A number of easily accessible quality metrics for the self organizing map and the centroid based cluster model.
