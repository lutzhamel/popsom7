Description: Methods for building self-organizing maps (SOMs) with a number of distinguishing features such automatic centroid detection and cluster visualization using starbursts.  For more details see the paper "Improved Interpretability of the Unified Distance Matrix with Connected Components" by Hamel and Brown (2011) in <ISBN:1-60132-168-6>.  The package provides user-friendly access to two models we construct: (a) a SOM model and (b) a centroid based clustering model. The package also exposes a number of quality metrics for the quantitative evaluation of the map, Hamel (2016) <doi:10.1007/978-3-319-28518-4_4>.  Finally, we reintroduced our fast, vectorized training algorithm for SOM with substantial improvements. It is about an order of magnitude faster than the canonical, stochastic C implementation <doi:10.1007/978-3-030-01057-7_60>.
